## 🐳 **Deploying with Docker**  

### **1️⃣ Build the Docker Image**  

```bash
docker build -t transcriptor-api .
```

### **2️⃣ Run the Docker Container**  

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 transcriptor-api
```

The API will be live at **http://localhost:8000** 🚀

## 🔥 **Using the API**  

### **Uploading an Audio File for Transcription**  

Make a **POST request** to `/transcribe/` with an audio file:  

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/transcribe/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@example.wav'
```

#### **Response Example**  

```json
{
  "transcription": "Hello, welcome to this meeting. Let's discuss our strategy..."
}
```
